## Agar recipe that iterated over time to enhance casting in the hard silicone mold

First recipe, simple test to understand how the jelly-like material can be created: 
-2gr Agar Agar
-1/4 Cups of Water

Results: hard, but breaks and also a bit watery.
Conclusion after days: The material was starting to get mold and decompose. 

Second iteration:
-4gr Agar Agar
-1/4 Cups of Water

Results: harder tha the first version, since Agar ratio was increased. It turned out more plastic-like

Third iteration:
-4gr Agar Agar
-1/4 Cups of Water
-25 gr Cornstarch

Results: It turned out more "organic sense", more elastic and plastic-like
Conclusion: It was concluded that this postive outcome was a result of waiting for the materials to become "gooey". It needs to start becoming a sort of paste that reminds of "silicone". The texture achived with the cornstarch wasn't the best, and it was even harder to pour when casting.

Fourth iteratation:
From these point on, I started using Glycerine in the recipe try-outs as recommended by workshops heads at CERCCO. 
The first recipe done with Glycerine:

-2gr Agar Agar
-15 cl Water
-2 teaspoons of glycerol
-5 drops of linseed oil

Conclusions: outcomne was to watery

Fifth iteration:
This iteration was based on the fourth one, but less water was used: 7.5cl.
This was the best iteratio so far and the consistency when pouring the bioplastic was really siropy rather than gooey.

Sixth iteration:
For this try-out I used as less water as possible. I used around 4 cl of water to see the outcome. The outcome was really hard to pour in the mold. After implemennting my own experiments and gathering knowledge based onn research and testing I decided to also a test recipe by the WdKa Academy in the Netherlands.
Recipe:
-10gr Agar
-30gr Glycerine
-500 ml Water
-2 drops of oil

This recipe helped me further but still needed to be adapted to nmy needs. I made some variations and tried changing of ratios, also taking into account material reduction when boiling.

The recipe eventually iterated to:
2 gr Agar
6 gr Glicerine
6 cl Water

I reduced the water to achieve a less watery material, but I had to play with the heating of the material as not to loose a lot of it and to still be able (in this case) to cast in a smaller scale, while still achieving a gooey connsistency that would affect the final look and feel of the plastic. 

After reduction, the aforementioned ratio allowed me to cast 2,5 cl of material.

The ingredients ratio was scaled up first:

8gr Agar
24gr Glycerine
24 cl Water

and then scaled down the water and glicerine to have a nicer finish and to be able to unmold the bioplastic.

Final recipe:
8 gr Agar Agar
10 cl Water
10 gr Glicerine
5 drops of food coloring
2 drops of Linseed oil

Procedure:
Before startinng: add linseed oil to the walls of the mold, so that the bioplastic is easier to demold afterwards add Q-tips to the narrow edges where the material is hard to pour. This will expand the silicone a bit and will let the material go through.
Mix oil, coloring and water in a measuring cup.
Set heat to high(7) and let boil.
Incorporate agar gr one by one (bags come in 2gr or 4gr) while stirring
Let the Agar react when boiling 
Turn heat down(3) and incorporate glycerine
Stir for a while until a sirop-like mixture is achieved
Turn heat up (7) until a paste-like mixture is achieved
Cast in mold and remove Q-tips quickly and shake the mold a bit so that the material fills the ubbles left by the Q-tips.
