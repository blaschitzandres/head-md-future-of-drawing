Today we had the design [crit](/presentations/HEAD-MD1_Caran-d-Ache_Andres-AcostaBlaschitz_iHeart.pdf) with Caran D'Ache. We were able to showcase our prototypes and recieve direct feedback from our porfessors, external lecturer and the head of communication at Caran D'Ache. It was exciting to have real time feeback of not just the lecturers but from other students. The feedback and the collaborative atmosphere definetely evoke a nice gut feeling for the upcoming weeks and further development of the project.

Today we were preparing the presentations for the design crit with Caran D'Ache. The excitement is in the air, but it feels awesome to have the support of such designers like Laure Krayenbruhl. Even though the feedback is subtle and neutral, it gives really helpful insights on the prototypes and creative process.

The day was productive as we are having time to actually add final touches and to repurpose our products for the upcoming Caran D'Ache crit on wednesday. I had to let Laure's feddback sink and now everything makes more sense.

Today was a prototyping day that mostly use to modify and craft from scratch some ideas regarding a prototype that makes allusion to a product that measures your bpm rate and maps it with colors. The device is interesting. However, some parts of the "puzzle" are missing.

The day was productive. I sketched some new ideas for the Caran D'Ache Project. I am getting into biometrics, bpm and speculative design. I feel like there is some interesting about speculating on a sci-future where only digital ink drawing is possible.
